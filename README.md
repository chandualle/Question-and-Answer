# Question-and-Answer
How it Works
The script generates random arithmetic problems with operands between 2 and 8.
Users are prompted to solve these problems and input their answers.
If the answer is correct, the script provides positive feedback and moves to the next problem.
For incorrect answers, the script guides users by indicating whether the correct answer is greater or lesser than their input.
The script tracks the number of wrong answers given by the user and the time taken to solve all the questions.
